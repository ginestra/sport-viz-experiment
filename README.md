```

## Data Files

- `public/data/players.csv`: Women's football player network data
- `public/data/player-success.csv`: Player success and popularity metrics
- `public/data/family-tree.json`: Family tree data structure (JSON format)

## Experiment Management

Experiments can be tagged with visibility and featured status:

- **Visibility**:
  - `public`: Visible in searches and category listings
  - `private`: Hidden from searches and listings (accessible via direct URL)

- **Featured**: Public experiments can be marked as featured to appear on the home page

Configure these in `src/data/experiments.js`.

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel.

### Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Vite configuration from `vercel.json`
4. **Set environment variables** (required for collaborative writing feature):
   - Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (your Supabase project URL)
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (your Supabase anon/public key)
   - Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (your Supabase service role key - server-side only)
   - Enable for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments
5. **Redeploy** after setting variables
6. Deploy with one click

Future pushes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger deployments.

**📖 See `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions.**
